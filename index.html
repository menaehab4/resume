        <p>I am from Egypt. I have been living in the US for seven years. I speak Arabic and English. I am an outdoor person. I like going to the beach,
          going out with friends, taking a road trip with my wife. My only and lovley distination is Orlando, FL because it is the only place I traveled to in the country.
          I love food, but I watch my weight too. Since I got my first PC at twelve years old, I loved the Computer Science field. I used to take all of my PC parts out
          and try to see how the Computer works. I imigrated to the US when I was twenty years old. Since day one in the US, I had a dream that I need to be a successful person and be independent too.
